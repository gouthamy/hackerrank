Explanation

Initially all plants are alive.

Plants = {(6,1), (5,2), (8,3), (4,4), (7,5), (10,6), (9,7)}

Plants[k] = (i,j) => jth plant has pesticide amount = i.

After the 1st day, 4 plants remain as plants 3, 5, and 6 die.

Plants = {(6,1), (5,2), (4,4), (9,7)}

After the 2nd day, 3 plants survive as plant 7 dies.

Plants = {(6,1), (5,2), (4,4)}

After the 3rd day, 3 plants survive and no more plants die.

Plants = {(6,1), (5,2), (4,4)}

After the 2nd day the plants stop dying.
